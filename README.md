# AWS CI/CD Pipeline for Cloud-Based Software Deployment

This project demonstrates an **automated cloud deployment pipeline** using **AWS services** like **S3**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and **CloudWatch**. It implements an end-to-end process for deploying a web application, from source code updates to continuous integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring. This project follows industry best practices for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment), enabling seamless software delivery in the cloud.

## Key Features:
- **CI/CD Pipeline Automation**: Fully automated pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the application using **GitHub Actions**.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Uploads application packages to **S3** as part of the deployment process.
- **Elastic Beanstalk Deployment**: Deploys the application to **Elastic Beanstalk**, handling scaling and infrastructure management.
- **Cloud Monitoring & Logging**: Utilizes **AWS CloudWatch** for real-time application health monitoring and logging.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Designed to handle large-scale deployments with minimal manual intervention.

## Project Architecture:
The architecture follows a modular, cloud-based approach with the following services:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline, running tests and deployments.
- **AWS S3**: Stores the application artifact (e.g., zip file or container image) for deployment.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploys and scales the application based on cloud infrastructure management.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors application health and performance, and provides logging/alerting for issues.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Python** (Flask or FastAPI for back-end development)
- **AWS S3** (stores application artifacts)
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** (PaaS for application deployment)
- **GitHub Actions** (automates CI/CD workflows)
- **AWS CloudWatch** (monitors and logs application health)
- **AWS CLI** (interacts with AWS services)

## Setup and Installation:

### Prerequisites:
- AWS account with access to **S3**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and **CloudWatch**.
- Python 3.x installed locally.
- GitHub account for managing CI/CD and version control.

### Steps to Set Up:
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-ci-cd-pipeline.git
    ```

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:
    Set up your **AWS CLI** with IAM permissions for **S3** and **Elastic Beanstalk** deployment:
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

3. **Deploy the Application**:
    - Push changes to GitHub, and the pipeline will automatically trigger the **GitHub Actions** workflow to:
        - Build the app
        - Run tests
        - Deploy to **Elastic Beanstalk** via **S3**
    - AWS **Elastic Beanstalk** will handle the scaling and infrastructure management of the application.

## How It Works:
1. **Code Commit**: When code changes are pushed to GitHub, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered.
2. **CI/CD Process**: GitHub Actions runs tests and builds the application, packaging it for deployment.
3. **Upload to S3**: The application artifact is uploaded to **AWS S3** for storage.
4. **Deployment**: The application is deployed to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** using the artifact in **S3**.
5. **Monitoring**: The applicationâ€™s performance and health are monitored through **AWS CloudWatch**, and logs are available for debugging and tracking issues.
